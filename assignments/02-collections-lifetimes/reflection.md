General readability of each implementation:
I think that the prescriptive implementations are generally easier to parse for somebody with less programming experience. The functional versions look cleaner, but often take longer to understand.
Ease of implementation from a software development standpoint
For me, the prescriptive implementations are often initally faster to implement, because I have more flexibility over control flow. However, the fuctional implementations can sometimes be very concise for some problems.
Scalaibility of each implementation
I think both implementations are scalable, however the functional implementations are much easier to parallelize.
Your preference towards one style or the other
I think there is a place for both styles â€” some things are really annoying to implement in a functional style, but others can look very clean and be more intuitive functionally.
